Devops 101 Code Phase

The Code phase focuses on writing secure, maintainable, and high-quality code. In this phase, teams:

    Collaborate using version control systems (e.g., Git)

    Follow secure coding practices and style guides

    Integrate automated code scanning (SAST) for early vulnerability detection

    Use pre-commit hooks and linting tools to catch issues early

    Embrace peer reviews and pair programming to improve code quality

Security is embedded directly into the development process, ensuring that the codebase remains resilient from the startâ€”long before deployment.
