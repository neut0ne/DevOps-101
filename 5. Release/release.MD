ðŸš€ DevOps 101 Release Phase

The Release phase ensures that only verified, secure, and high-quality artifacts are approved for deployment. It focuses on:

    Automating release approvals through policy-as-code

    Verifying builds against security gates and compliance checks

    Managing versioning, release notes, and artifact promotion

    Enforcing auditability and traceability for all releases

    Ensuring minimal risk by integrating canary, blue-green, or staged releases

This phase acts as the final checkpoint before productionâ€”ensuring trust, control, and accountability in every release.
