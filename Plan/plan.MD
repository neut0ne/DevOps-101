ðŸ§  Plan Phase

The Plan phase sets the foundation for secure, high-quality software development. In this stage, teams:

    Define requirements, goals, and user stories

    Align on business value, compliance, and security needs

    Incorporate threat modeling and risk assessments early

    Emphasize collaboration between dev, security, and ops

By integrating security from the start, the Plan phase ensures that development is guided by a shared understanding of risks, architecture, and desired outcomesâ€”setting the stage for secure, agile delivery throughout the DevOps loop.
