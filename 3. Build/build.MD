🛠️ DevOps 101 Build Phase

The Build phase compiles and packages the application into deployable artifacts while embedding security and compliance checks. Key practices include:

    Creating repeatable, automated builds (e.g., with CI pipelines)

    Integrating software composition analysis (SCA) to detect vulnerable dependencies

    Applying security policies to control what gets built

    Generating secure, signed artifacts for traceability and trust

    Ensuring builds are reproducible and free from tampering

This phase bridges development and deployment by turning code into trusted components—ready for safe delivery.
