ðŸ§ª DevOps 101 Test Phase

The Test phase ensures that software is both functionally correct and secure before it moves further down the pipeline. Key activities include:

    Running automated tests: unit, integration, and end-to-end

    Performing security testing like DAST, fuzzing, and dependency scanning

    Validating against compliance and policy requirements

    Shifting security testing left to catch vulnerabilities early

    Using test automation to speed up feedback loops

By embedding security into every test, this phase reinforces confidence that the application behaves as intendedâ€”without exposing risk.
